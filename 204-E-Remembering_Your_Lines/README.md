# Challenge #204 [Easy] Remembering your lines

### Input Description
You will be given a single line containing a phrase that appears exactly
once somewhere in the text of the play. You can assume that the phrase
in the input uses the same case as the phrase in the source material,
and that the full input is contained in a single line.

### Output Description
You will output the line containing the quote, as well all the lines
directly above and below it which are also dialog lines. In other words,
output the whole "passage".

All the dialog in the source material is indented 4 spaces, you can
choose to keep that indent for your output, or you can remove, whichever
you want.
